# How to use

For small QUBO problem try airbus.ipynb with COLAB.

For large QUBO problem try airbus.nb with MATHEMATICA.

# Todo

1. Qbsolv https://github.com/dwavesystems/qbsolv/ ✅
2. Include linear coefficients in diagonal of QUBO quadratic matrix ✅ 
3. implement figure 1 of paper && determine penalty factors
4. consider other constraints
